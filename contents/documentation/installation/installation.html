<p>Below are listed instructions on how to install McXtrace on some of the supported platforms. For other platforms please use the source tarball distribution.

<p> 
The simplest way to get a McXtrace running on this type of system is to simply add the McXtrace repository to your list of source for .deb files, and then rely on <pre>apt-get</pre> to get any required dependencies.
This may be done by issuing the following commands as root:
<pre>
cd /etc/apt/sources_list.d/
wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
apt-get update
</pre>
and then do either of:
<pre>
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-perl
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-python
</pre>
<!--Debian testing users (or indeed Linux Mint Debian Edition) may require some extra packages that are not present in the standard debian repositories.
E.g. If this is the case and you try to install  mcxtrace-suite-perl you will get an error message complaining about a missing <b>libtk-perl-codetext</b> package.
To help fix these issues, we have packages some extra .deb files, which may be installed by doing:
<pre>
wget http://download.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra.tgz
tar xzf mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra.tgz
cd mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra
./install_extras
</pre>
after which you may run e.g. <pre>apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-perl</pre>
-->
<p>If you prefer installing the .deb files manually, the simplest way is to download the file mcxtrace-1.2-deb-64.tgz, unpack it, and install then .deb files contained therein using the package manager dpkg.
To get McXtrace working
in its traditional form (with the <a href="www.perl.org">perl</a> based GUI and other tools) please
install the .deb file in the following manner and order:
</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-1.2-64.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-comps-1.2-64.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-tools-perl-1.2-64.deb</pre>
Also included in the tarball are new (experimental) versions of mxrun, mxdisplay, and mxplot built using Python which offer additional features. Furthermore we also supply copies of supporting packages e.g. Pgplot for simple installation.
To use the GUI and mcrun scripts etc. you <i>do</i> need a <i>perl</i>, and/or <i>python</i>-interpreter installed. They are usually readily installable from your packaging system. For instance:
<pre>sudo apt-get install perl</pre>

<p><i>We suggest you uninstall previous versions of McXtrace before installing McXtrace 1.2.</i> The versions may interfere with each other on some systems. If you experience problems please don't hesitate to contact the development team (for instance through the mailing list) - we will help you out ASAP.

<p>Firstly, make sure you have strawberry perl installed. For instance by downloading and installing INSTALL_FIRST_strawberry-perl-5.18.2.1-32bit.msi from <a href="http://downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.2/windows/">here</a>. This is also includes the mingw c-compiler for windows.
Please note that we do recommend using the 32 bit version even though you have a 64 bit system, as we have found inaccuracies and other strange errors to occur otherwise.
</p>
<p>Secondly, download and install the McXtrace 1.2 self extracting installer INSTALL_SECOND_AS_ADMIN_McXtrace-Metapackage-1.2-win32.exe from <a href="http://downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.2/windows/">here</a>. Please make sure you run this as an Adminstrator. During the installation process you may choose to install optional packages such the new python based replacement scripts offering some additional faetures.
</p>
Python is not shipped with the installation archive, partly because the size of the installer would become impractical, partly for licensing reasons.

<p>For installation from source code or directly from the development tree, see <a href="Installation-suppl.html">this page</a>

<a name="McXtrace 1.5 is released"></a> <h3> McXtrace 1.5 is released</h3>
[25/10/2019] Dear all - The McXtrace team is proud to announce the release of McXtrace version 1.5. The release contains many improvements to computations, model improvements, new components and example instruments, as well as general stability improvements. Head on over to <a href="http://download.mcxtrace.org">downloads.mcxtrace.org</a> and get yours while it is still hot!
<p>
Packages have been built on Debian Stable (10), Centos 7, Mac OS Catalina, and for windows 64 bit. Fedora 29 rpms are also available.
Debian and Centos packages are available through our repositories (using apt-get and yum). Mac users should simply be able to download the bundle and drag it to <code>/Applications</code>, following the instructions in the README.
<p>

As always - if you experience _any_ problems please don't hesitate to contact the McXtrace team. Either through the mailing list or indeed submit a ticket on the McCode issue tracker on github <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/issues">github.com/McStasMcXtrace/issues</a>.
  
<p>

<li> The shipped MCPL-library has been updated</li>
<li> Updated and streamlines the installation procedure - such that windows and Mac installs are now (almost completely sandboxed).</li>
<li> New components:
        <ol> 
        <li> Bragg_crystal (replacing Perfect_crystal)</li>
        <li> Bragg_crystal_BC</li>

<a name="McXtrace 1.4 on Mac OS 10.14 Mojave"></a> <h3> McXtrace 1.4 on Mac OS 10.14 Mojave </h3>
It appears that McXtrace can fail to compile the generated c-code on Mac OS
10.14, with an error that <code>math.h</code> cannot be found. A cause for this
may be that with the newest release of XCode 10 there is no longer a
<code>/usr/include</code> directory by default. See the release notes for more
info: <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes">X
Code 10 Release notes</a>. 
For now, a package is distributed with XCode 10 that
will create <code>/usr/include</code> and its contents: 
<pre><code>
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg 
</code></pre>

The release notes state that this package will <i>not</i> be packaged in future releases of XCode. We are working on a long term solution.

<a name="McXtrace 1.4: workaround for a python issue on windows 10"</a> <h3> <span class="mw-headline">McXtrace 1.4: workaround for a python issue on windows 10</span></h3>
[27/11/2017] A reported issue with McXtrace 1.4 and numpy has found a workaround.

The procedure below has been reported to work, if when starting an McXtrace simiulation for the GUI, you happen to see error messages complaing about missing dlls and at the end of them (there can be a lot) find something like the following:
<pre><code>
File "C:\mcxtrace-1.4\miniconda3\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\__init__.py", line 14, in <module>
from . import multiarray ImportError: DLL load failed ...
</code></pre>

If this applies to you then you may try this, which has been reported to work:
<ol>
    <li> Move the numpy folder in the miniconda3 folder <code>c:/mcxtrace-1.4/minoconda3/Lib/site-packages/numpy</code> out of the way.</li>
    <li> Start a mcxtrace shell session</li>
    <li> In the shell, issue the command: <code>pip install numpy</code></li>
</ol>

<a name="McXtrace 1.4 known bugs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> McXtrace 1.4: known bugs</span></h3>
[16/08/2017] A list of known bugs in the McXtrace 1.4 dsitribution. These will be fixed in an upcoming 1.4.1.
<ul>
  <li> Lens_parab &amp; Lens_parab_Cyl: A missing 'I' in the header (line 11) trips the intersection algorithm. Fixed in the development tree</li>
  <li> mxplot-pyqtgraph  on windows: An error in a post-install script causes
  the file c:\mcxtrace-1.4\bin\mxplot-pyqtgraph to have a typo where it
  says mcplot.py instead of mxplot.py as it should. The mxplot-pyqtgraph
  script is generated install time - the install procedure has been
  altered to fix this. 
  For existing systems the simple workaround is to
  either edit that file in place or to replace it with one from this link:<a
  href="downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/fixes">downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/fixes</a>.
  </li>
  <li> On windows, if you want to use the Undulator component, you must also
  install The GNU scientific Library (GSL). It is available from <a
  href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm">gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl</a>.
  This also implies that you probably need to edit the mcxtrace compiler
  flags. Go to File->Configure and add something along the lines
  "-Lc:\mcxtrace\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\lib -Ic:\mcxtrace\Program
  Files (x86)\GnuWin32\include" to the C flags box for mcxxtrace to be
  find the libraries compile time.</li>

<a name="McXtrace 1.4 Released!"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> McXtrace 1.4 is released!</span></h3>
[23/06/2017] The McXtrace team is proud to announce that McXtrace 1.4 has finally been released. In the first step packages are made available for debian systems, while the testing trolls do their work on the rpms and windows file to make sure the installation procedure runs as smooth as possible. Fortunately testing trolls do not celebrate Swedish midsummers' eve.

New features of 1.4 (pasted from the CHANGES file):
<ol>
    <li> Source_pt, Source_flat, Source_gaussian, and Source_div now behave in the same manner wrt. phase. The relevant parameters
        are randomphase and phase. If randomphase is !=0 the phase is completely random, if ==0 the value of phase is used.</li>
    <li> EPSD_monitor: Has a parameter nE which denotes a number of energy bins. if >1 the monitor will output a number of files.
        each corresponding to an energy bin.</li>
    <li> Lens_parab, Lens_parab_Cyl The functionality of the _rough versions of these components have been merged into the main components
and the _rough versions themselves retired.</li>

The McCode-team is happy to announce that we have now moved to using git for version control and consequently also moved the code repository to
GitHub. Effective immediately McXtrace (and McStas) code will live on <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace" class="external text" title="http://github.com/McStasMcXtrace" rel="nofollow">github.com/McStasMcXtrace</a>.

<a name="Perl_inst_prob"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Perl related installation problem on windows</span></h3>
We have lately found that in a few rare cases, there is a problem with the perl tools installation process on Windows 7. If the extra ppds cannot be gathered by the installation script it might be caused by a permission issue in the perl site directory. If you encounter some problem along these lines please make sure that actually have <b>Full control</b>-permissions over the perl directory and its subdirectories. If that didnø't help pleasde donø't hesitate to use the mailing list (or indeed the facebook page)


<a name="Patch released" id="numpars_patch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">bugfix patch</span></h3>
We have found a rather serious bug (thank's Carsten) in McXtrace which made the the <pre>SPLIT</pre> keyword generate rubbish photons. A patch file is available here <a href="http://download.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.0_num_pars.patch">mcxtrace-1.0_num_pars.patch</a>. To apply it do something along the lines.

The McXtrace team are very happy to be a part of the Three-code joint tutorial
workshop to be help at the ESRF in the beginning of June 2013. Jointly
organized by the maintainers (Manuel Sanchez del Rio, Oleg Chubar and Erik Bergbäck Knudsen) of the simulation software packages SHADOW, SRW and
McXtrace, it will give participants hand-on experience with simulation of X-ray
instrumentation and experiments.

<p>At long last the McXtrace team is proud to present the first public release
candidate of McXtrace 1.1. Binary installation packages are available for
debian and prm based Linux/Unix distributions, recent Windows (including 8, 7
and XP), and MacOSX (10.8, 10.7, and 10.6). Please download the appropriate version from

Among the most major changes are
<ul>
  <li> Separated packages for kernel, component libary and tools. This will allow the McXtrace team to repsond quicker to bugs as it allows us to make update release to the component library without packaging a new kernel.</li> 
  <li> A completely revamped build system: We have moved from autotools to <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> - so <i>from source</i> users will have to install CMake (>2.8) on their system. See  <a href="/Installation">installation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li> Several significant changes to the component library:
  <ol><li> Updated Source_lab</li>
    <li>Chopper_simple</li>

The latest McXtrace news.

<a name="McXtrace 1.2 Released!"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> McXtrace 1.2 is released!</span></h3>
Finally McXtrace 1.2 is out. This release focuses on solidifying the models that exists and has greatly improved installation procedure.
Packages are now bundled for easy installation. As of day one - packages are built for:
<ul>
    <li> Debian class GNU/Linux systems</li>
    <li> Rpm-based (e.g. RedHat) GNU/Linux systems</li>
    <li> Windows systems (including 7, 8, and 8.1)</li>
    <li> Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Maverics</li>
</ul>
Packages for further platforms can be built upon request - forthcoming is also a FreeBSD port.

Please report any problems that you may experience to the maintainer <a href="mailto:erkn_AT_fysik.dtu.dk"></a>. We will deal with all inconveniences ASAP.

Other new features in 1.2 include
<ul>
    <li> Interface source components to SPECTRA, Simplex, and GENESIS 1.3.</li>
    <li> Experimental Bending magnet and Wiggler components</li>
    <li> Absorption feature added to Moelcule_2stata sample</li>
    <li> Several more examples and test instruments</li>
</ul> 

<a name="Perl_inst_prob"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Perl related installation problem on windows</span></h3>
We have lately found that in a few rare cases, there is a problem with the perl tools installation process on Windows 7. If the extra ppds cannot be gathered by the installation script it might be caused by a permission issue in the perl site directory. If you encounter some problem along these lines please make sure that actually have <b>Full control</b>-permissions over the perl directory and its subdirectories. If that didnø't help pleasde donø't hesitate to use the mailing list (or indeed the facebook page)

<a name="Patch released" id="numpars_patch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">bugfix patch</span></h3>
We have found a rather serious bug (thank's Carsten) in McXtrace which made the the <pre>SPLIT</pre> keyword generate rubbish photons. A patch file is available here <a href="http://download.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.0_num_pars.patch">mcxtrace-1.0_num_pars.patch</a>. To apply it do something along the lines.
<pre>
        cd /usr/local/lib/mcxtrace-1.0
        patch -p1 < /path/to/file/mcxtrace-1.0_num_pars.patch
</pre>
if you have the patch utility available. N.b. this is fixed upstream.

<a name="McXtrace 1.1 released" id="McXtrace-1.1"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">McXtrace 1.1 Released</span></h3>
We are extremely happy to announce the release of McXtrace 1.1  Just in time for the 3-Codes workshop. This release is based on the well known perl tools while we are testing new solutions for python based plotting tools. Please head over to the download area to get your copy. Happy simulating!

<a name="McXtrace_overview_article" id="McXtrace_article"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Journal Article Published</span></h3>
A journal article on McXtrace has been published in the June issue of <a href="http://journals.iucr.org/j/">Journal of Applied Crystallography</a>.
Please follow this link: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0021889813007991">Journal of Applied Crystallography, 2013, Volume 46, pages 679-696</a>, to get your copy.

<a name="JointWorkshop" id="JointWorkshop"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Joint Tutorial Workshop </span></h3>
The McXtrace team are very happy to be a part of the Three-code joint tutorial
workshop to be help at the ESRF in the beginning of June 2013. Jointly
organized by the maintainers (Manuel Sanchez del Rio, Oleg Chubar and Erik Bergbäck Knudsen) of the simulation software packages SHADOW, SRW and
McXtrace, it will give participants hand-on experience with simulation of X-ray
instrumentation and experiments.
Please see <a href="http://www.esrf.fr/events/synchrotron-optics-simulations-3-codes-tutorial">here</a> for more details.
<a name="McXtrace 1.1 release candidate 1b" id="McXtrace 1.1rc1b"></a><h3><span class "mw-headline">McXtrace 1.1 release candidate 1b</span></h3>
<p>At long last the McXtrace team is proud to present the first public release
candidate of McXtrace 1.1. Binary installation packages are available for
debian and prm based Linux/Unix distributions, recent Windows (including 8, 7
and XP), and MacOSX (10.8, 10.7, and 10.6). Please download the appropriate version from
<a href="http://download.mcxtrace.org" class="external text"
  title="http://download.mcxtrace.org" rel="nofollow">download area</a>. If you prefer, a source distribution is also available.
Among the most major changes are
<ul>
  <li> Separated packages for kernel, component libary and tools. This will allow the McXtrace team to repsond quicker to bugs as it allows us to make update release to the component library without packaging a new kernel.</li> 
  <li> A completely revamped build system: We have moved from autotools to <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> - so <i>from source</i> users will have to install CMake (>2.8) on their system. See  <a href="/Installation">installation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li> Several significant changes to the component library:
  <ol><li> Updated Source_lab</li>
    <li>Chopper_simple</li>
    <li>Lens_kinoform</li>
    <li>Mirror_parabolic</li>
    <li>Twin_KB_ML</li>
    <li>EPSD_monitor</li>
    <li>Monitor_nD</li>
    <li>PreMonitor_nD</li>
    <li>W_psd_monitor </li>
    <li>Molecule_2state</li>
    <li>Shadow_input</li>
    <li>Shadow_output</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

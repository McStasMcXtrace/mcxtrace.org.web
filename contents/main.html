The latest McXtrace news.

<a name="McXtrace 1.6 is released"></a> <h3> McXtrace 1.6 is released</h3>
[16/08/2021] Dear simulators,
The McXtrace team is happy to announce the release of McXtrace version 1.6.<br>
<p>
At present there are binary packages built for
<ol>
<li>Debian/Ubuntu class systems</li>
<li>Red hat Fedora 33 and newer</li>
<li>Windows 10 / 64 bit</li>
<li>MacOS -- both Arm and Intel-based</li>
</ol>
Please go to <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/INSTALL-McXtrace">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/INSTALL-McXtrace</a> for specific installation instructions for your platform. It is always our ambition to stay close to the "generic" installation procedure for the various platforms. 

If that fails you may also build McXtrace directly from source by cloning our github repository and proceed using cmake.

Should installation elude you completely we will shortly provide a docker based solution - so stay tuned for that.

As always - should you encounter problems please don't hesitate to reach out through any of our channels: mailing list/direct email/generate a ticket on github, etc.

Happy simulation!

<a name="McXtrace 1.4 on Mac OS 10.14 Mojave"></a> <h3> McXtrace 1.4 on Mac OS 10.14 Mojave </h3>
It appears that McXtrace can fail to compile the generated c-code on Mac OS
10.14, with an error that <code>math.h</code> cannot be found. A cause for this
may be that with the newest release of XCode 10 there is no longer a
<code>/usr/include</code> directory by default. See the release notes for more
info: <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes">X
Code 10 Release notes</a>. 
For now, a package is distributed with XCode 10 that
will create <code>/usr/include</code> and its contents: 
<pre><code>
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg 
</code></pre>

The release notes state that this package will <i>not</i> be packaged in future releases of XCode. We are working on a long term solution. 

<a name="McXtrace 1.4: workaround for a python issue on windows 10"</a> <h3> <span class="mw-headline">McXtrace 1.4: workaround for a python issue on windows 10</span></h3>
[27/11/2017] A reported issue with McXtrace 1.4 and numpy has found a workaround.

The procedure below has been reported to work, if when starting an McXtrace simiulation for the GUI, you happen to see error messages complaing about missing dlls and at the end of them (there can be a lot) find something like the following:
<pre><code>
File "C:\mcxtrace-1.4\miniconda3\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\__init__.py", line 14, in <module>
from . import multiarray ImportError: DLL load failed ...
</code></pre>

If this applies to you then you may try this, which has been reported to work:
<ol>
    <li> Move the numpy folder in the miniconda3 folder <code>c:/mcxtrace-1.4/minoconda3/Lib/site-packages/numpy</code> out of the way.</li>
    <li> Start a mcxtrace shell session</li>
    <li> In the shell, issue the command: <code>pip install numpy</code></li>
</ol>


<a name="McXtrace 1.4 known bugs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> McXtrace 1.4: known bugs</span></h3>
[16/08/2017] A list of known bugs in the McXtrace 1.4 dsitribution. These will be fixed in an upcoming 1.4.1.
<ul>
    <li> Lens_parab &amp; Lens_parab_Cyl: A missing 'I' in the header (line 11) trips the intersection algorithm. Fixed in the development tree</li>
    <li> mxplot-pyqtgraph  on windows: An error in a post-install script causes
        the file c:\mcxtrace-1.4\bin\mxplot-pyqtgraph to have a typo where it
        says mcplot.py instead of mxplot.py as it should. The mxplot-pyqtgraph
        script is generated install time - the install procedure has been
        altered to fix this. 
        For existing systems the simple workaround is to
        either edit that file in place or to replace it with one from this link:<a
           href="downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/fixes">downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/fixes</a>.
    </li>
    <li> On windows, if you want to use the Undulator component, you must also
        install The GNU scientific Library (GSL). It is available from <a
            href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm">gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl</a>.
        This also implies that you probably need to edit the mcxtrace compiler
        flags. Go to File->Configure and add something along the lines
        "-Lc:\mcxtrace\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\lib -Ic:\mcxtrace\Program
        Files (x86)\GnuWin32\include" to the C flags box for mcxxtrace to be
        find the libraries compile time.</li> 
</ul>
<a name="McXtrace 1.4 Released!"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> McXtrace 1.4 is released!</span></h3>
[23/06/2017] The McXtrace team is proud to announce that McXtrace 1.4 has finally been released. In the first step packages are made available for debian systems, while the testing trolls do their work on the rpms and windows file to make sure the installation procedure runs as smooth as possible. Fortunately testing trolls do not celebrate Swedish midsummers' eve.

New features of 1.4 (pasted from the CHANGES file):
<ol>
    <li> Source_pt, Source_flat, Source_gaussian, and Source_div now behave in the same manner wrt. phase. The relevant parameters
        are randomphase and phase. If randomphase is !=0 the phase is completely random, if ==0 the value of phase is used.</li>
    <li> EPSD_monitor: Has a parameter nE which denotes a number of energy bins. if >1 the monitor will output a number of files.
        each corresponding to an energy bin.</li>
    <li> Lens_parab, Lens_parab_Cyl The functionality of the _rough versions of these components have been merged into the main components
and the _rough versions themselves retired.</li>
    <li> Support for binary file dump of photons in the mcpl-format is added.</li>
    <li> On debian class systems, McXtrace now installs to /usr/share to be more standards compliant.</li>

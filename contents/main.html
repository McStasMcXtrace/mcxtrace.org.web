<a name="New ready-to-run McXtrace box in a browser"></a> <h3>New ready-to-run McXtrace box in a browser</h3>
<p>[18/02/2022] Dear all, we are happy to provide a <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/mcxtrace-binder">ready-to-run system with McXtrace pre-installed</a>. 
It typically pulls-out an 8-cores computer running at Binder, for free, with both McXtrace 1.7 and 3.0 (with MPI multi-core support but no GPU).
Perfect for running McXtrace from anywhere, for training/schools/workshops.
	
<p>Start it in a single click here: <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/McStasMcXtrace/mcxtrace-binder/master?urlpath=desktop"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg"></a>
<p>(Please note that load-time can be a couple of minutes.)

<p><h3>Update:</h3>
The above docker image has been pushed to dockerhub and can also be run locally at your machine using docker:
<ul>
  <li>Install docker (if needed)
  <li><pre>docker run -p 8888:8888 docker.io/mccode/mcxtrace-1.7-3.0:1.0</pre>
  <li>Connect your browser to the URL communicated by the docker command

<a name="Updated RPM metapackages for McXtrace 3.0"></a> <h3>Updated RPM metapackages for McXtrace 3.0</h3>
<p>[09/02/2022] Dear all,
<p>If you were fast enough to try out installing McXtrace 3.0 already
yesterday on your CentOS or Fedora system, you may have come across
some installation issues, as the mcxtrace-suite-python-ng packages had
a couple of shortcomings.
<p>Updated packages have now been uploaded, please use yum clean and
yum reinstall to have access to the updates.

<a name="McXtrace 3.0 is released"></a> <h3>McXtrace 3.0 is released</h3>
<p>[08/02/2022] Dear all,

<p>The McXtrace team is happy to announce that our McXtrace 3.0 "next generation" release is now available.

<p>McXtrace 3.0 is the first release in the 3.0 series with a completely rewritten code-generator and thereby
support for GPU-acceleration through the OpenACC programming model. 

<p>We have seen speedups of 1-2 orders of magnitude over the CPU version, depending on the computational
Problem / complexity.

<p>THANKS:
<ul>
  <li>Thanks to: all members of the team (and also to the McStas team), for pulling together to make this possible.
  <li>Thanks to the mentors at the GPU Hackathons that really made this happen
  <li>Thanks to NVIDIA for making the hackathons happen
</ul>

<p>INSTALLATION:
<ul>
  <li>Installation instructions for McXtrace-3.0 and support libraries
  may be found on our the <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/Install_McXtrace-3.x">McCode github-site</a>
  <li>OpenACC acceleration is at present available out of the box on Linux. 
  <li>On windows it is possible to target GPU-acceleration through Windows Subsystem For Linux v2: WSL2. 
  <li>The present McXtrace-3.0 implementation relies the concept managed memory, which
  is at the time of writing only supported by the Linux version of the NVHPC-kit
  (downloadable from <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk">https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk</a>)
</ul>

<p>For more information on the GPU-features of the release, please
consult the <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/blob/mcxtrace-3.0-release/CHANGES_McXtrace">CHANGES_McXtrace
document on GitHub</a> and the section <a
href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki">"Migrating from
McStas 2.x to 3.x (and McXtrace 1.x to 3.x)" in our McCode wiki</a>

<p>
Happy simulation!

<a name="McXtrace 1.7 is released"></a> <h3> McXtrace 1.7 is released</h3>
[25/01/2022] Dear simulators,
The team is happy to announce that McXtrace 1.7 is out! 
<p>
1.7 has been focused mainly on stability and bugfixes, but also provides a set of new features.
Binary packages are provided for the main platforms: Debian /Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows 10, Mac OSX (arm and intel based).
As is the presenty custom, see  <a href="https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/INSTALL-McXtrace">https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/INSTALL-McXtrace</a> for speecific installation instructions for you platform.
<p>
Please also keep an eye out for the for upcoming release of McXtrace 3.0, which is a technology preview release of an improved code-generator enabling McXtrace to run on GPUs.
<p>
Happy simulation!

<p>

<p>The simplest and most standard way to install McXtrace on a debian/ubuntu type systems is to download the file mcxtrace-1.1rc1b-deb-(64|32).tgz, unpack and install then .deb file contained therein using the package manager dpkg.
For instance, on a 32 bit system, download the file mcxtrace-1.1rc1b-deb-32.tgz. As of release 1.1 McXtrace is split into several packages. TO get McXtrace working in its traditional form (with the perl based GUI and other tools) please install the .deb file in stal following manner:
</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-1.1rc1b-32.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-comps-1.1rc1b-32.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-tools-perl-1.1rc1b-32.deb</pre>
Also included in the tarball are new (experimental) versions of mxrun, mxdisplay, and mxplot built using Python which offer additional features. Furthermore we also supply copies of supporting packages e.g. Pgplot for simple installation.

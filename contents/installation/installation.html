<p>Below are listed instructions on how to install McXtrace on some of the supported platforms. For other platforms please use the source tarball distribution.

<p> 
The simplest way to get a McXtrace running on this type of system is to simply add the McXtrace repository to your list of source for .deb files, and then rely on <pre>apt-get</pre> to get any required dependencies.
This may be done by issuing the following commands as root:
<pre>
cd /etc/apt/sources_list.d/
wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
apt-get update
</pre>
and then do either of:
<pre>
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-perl
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-python
</pre>
<!--Debian testing users (or indeed Linux Mint Debian Edition) may require some extra packages that are not present in the standard debian repositories.
E.g. If this is the case and you try to install  mcxtrace-suite-perl you will get an error message complaining about a missing <b>libtk-perl-codetext</b> package.
To help fix these issues, we have packages some extra .deb files, which may be installed by doing:
<pre>
wget http://download.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra.tgz
tar xzf mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra.tgz
cd mcxtrace-1.1-Debian-Testing-Extra
./install_extras
</pre>
after which you may run e.g. <pre>apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-perl</pre>
-->
<p>If you prefer installing the .deb files manually, the simplest way is to download the file mcxtrace-1.2-deb-64.tgz, unpack it, and install then .deb files contained therein using the package manager dpkg.
To get McXtrace working
in its traditional form (with the <a href="www.perl.org">perl</a> based GUI and other tools) please
install the .deb file in the following manner and order:
</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-1.2-64.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-comps-1.2-64.deb</pre>
<pre>sudo dpkg --install mcxtrace-tools-perl-1.2-64.deb</pre>
Also included in the tarball are new (experimental) versions of mxrun, mxdisplay, and mxplot built using Python which offer additional features. Furthermore we also supply copies of supporting packages e.g. Pgplot for simple installation.
To use the GUI and mcrun scripts etc. you <i>do</i> need a <i>perl</i>, and/or <i>python</i>-interpreter installed. They are usually readily installable from your packaging system. For instance:
<pre>sudo apt-get install perl</pre>

<p>For installation from source code or directly from the development tree, see <a href="Installation-suppl.html">this page</a>

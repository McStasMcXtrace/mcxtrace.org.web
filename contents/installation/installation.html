The simplest way to get a McXtrace running on this type of system is to simply add the McXtrace repository to your list of source for .deb files, and then rely on <pre>apt-get</pre> to get any required dependencies.
This may be done by issuing the following commands as root:
<pre>
cd /etc/apt/sources_list.d/
wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
apt-get update
</pre>

This adds the mccode repository to the list of searched repositories:
<pre>
mcxtrace@debian:~$ apt-cache search mcxtrace |grep 1.4

mcxtrace-clustertools-1.4 - perl-cluster-tools built using CMake

</pre>
To avoid installing all of these packages individually it is possible to install a meta-package wich includes a typical set of the above:
<pre>
apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-python
</pre>
The old perl-based too√¶s are available, but we recommend you switch to the new python tools as the old tools are being decommissioned.

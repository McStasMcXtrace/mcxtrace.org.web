<a name="Mac OSX Installation" id="Mac_OSX"></a><h2>Mac OSX Installation Instructions</h2>

To install McXtrac on a computer running Mac OSX you first need to install XCode from the App store (or installation medium)
You must also install Command Line tools inside Xcode (Xcode -> Preferences-> Downloads -> Components) and also allow installation of third 
party software (System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere) - can be reset after the installation of the McXtrace bundle.
<p>

You may furhter install either Intel C (commercial product) or the version of gcc available from http://hpc.sourceforge.net, as they both work much better than the Apple-provided llvm and llvm-gcc compilers.
On MacOSX 10.8 and above (Mountain Lion, Mavericks), also install XQuartz (X11).
<p>

Afterwards, unzip your downloaded McXtrace bundle corresponding to your version of Mac OS X (we currently provide packages for 10.9 Maverics and 10.10 Yosemite) and run it. We can of course generate packages
for older versions of Mac OSX if necessary. Please let us know and we'll try to support your platform as well.
<p>

Apart from the dependencies mentioned above, the defaults of the installation bundle includes everything you need for a base installation of McXtrace, namely
<ul>
    <li>McXtrace code generator, components, instruments and datafiles</li>
    <li>The "classic" McXtrace Perl tools configured for use on your version of Mac OS X</li>
    <li>PGPLOT graphical backend for mxplot/mxdisplay</li>
    <li>McXtrace-specific extensions to Perl</li>
    <li>Tk widgets for Perl</li>
</ul>

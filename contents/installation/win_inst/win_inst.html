<p><i>We suggest you uninstall previous versions of McXtrace before installing McXtrace 1.4.</i> The versions may interfere with each other on some systems. If you experience problems please don't hesitate to contact the development team (for instance through the mailing list) - we will help you out ASAP.

<p>Firstly, make sure you have strawberry perl installed. For instance by downloading and installing the INSTALL_FIRST_...-file from from <a href="http://downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/windows/">here</a>. This is also includes the mingw c-compiler for windows.
Please note that we do recommend using the 32 bit version even though you have a 64 bit system, as we have found inaccuracies and other strange errors to occur otherwise.
</p>
<p>Secondly, download and install the McXtrace 1.2 self extracting installer INSTALL_SECOND_AS_ADMIN_McXtrace-Metapackage-1.4-win32.exe from <a href="http://downloads.mcxtrace.org/mcxtrace-1.4/windows/">here</a>. Please make sure you run this as an Adminstrator. During the installation process you may choose to install optional packages.
</p>
In the extras directory you may additionally find MS MPI-libraries and and
NeXus libraries. The former is the recommended way to run MPI on windows
systems, the latter is necessary if you prefer  to get you output in the NeXus-format (see description here: <a href"http://www.nexusformat.org/">The
NeXus format</a> instead of in the default ascii-based format.

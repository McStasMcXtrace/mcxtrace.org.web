<h1>Project goals</h1>
	<p>Our ultimate goal is to provide the X-ray scattering community with a powerful simulation code called <a href="/">McXtrace</a>, by combining excellence in X-ray scattering with Monte Carlo ray-tracing techniques.
</p><p>Boundary condition work packages include simulation of Small Angle Xray Scattering (SAXS) instruments, as well as a suite of more complex instruments at the ESRF, including the 3DXRD instrument, ID11.
</p><p>In the case of SAXS, we will utilize the newly developed <a href="/">software tool</a> for data analysis of experiments on nanosized, biological samples, the so-called Nano Disks.
</p><p>We are not staring from scratch, people from these established scientific software projects are involved:
</p><p><a href="http://www.mcstas.org" class="external text" title="http://www.mcstas.org" rel="nofollow">McStas</a> - world leading neutron ray-tracing simulation code.
<a href="http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/TBS/SciSoft/OurSoftware/raytracing/" class="external text" title="http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/TBS/SciSoft/OurSoftware/raytracing/" rel="nofollow">SHADOW and XOP</a> - legacy X-ray ray-tracing code and extensive materials library
</p><p>Connection with main centres of scattering techniques at <a href="http://www.ku.dk" class="external text" title="http://www.ku.dk" rel="nofollow">University of Copenhagen</a>, <a href="http://www.fys.dtu.dk" class="external text" title="http://www.fys.dtu.dk" rel="nofollow">DTU Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.esrf.eu" class="external text" title="http://www.esrf.eu" rel="nofollow">ESRF</a> and our industrial partner <a href="http://www.jjxray.dk" class="external text" title="http://www.jjxray.dk" rel="nofollow">JJ-Xray systems</a> will ensure a solid base of X-ray theory, device engineering and experimental techniques to build our software on.
</p><p>The complete project description, including work packages etc. is available in our <a href="/files/NABIIT_McXtrace.pdf" rel="nofollow">NABIIT application</a> to the Danish Strategic research Foundation (DSF).
